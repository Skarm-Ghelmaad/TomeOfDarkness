# Tome of Darkness
---

This module provides new archetypes, class features, feats, spell and items for Wrath of the Righteous.

And also some more random stuff that I wanted to see in the game.

All homebrew content or divergences from TT will be called out, but most homebrew content will probably be overpowered.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version.
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous.
3. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases) mod from the releases page.
4. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base/releases) mod from the releases page.
5. Download the mod from the releases page.
6. Install the mods by dragging the zip file from step 3 & 4 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab.

## Added Content

* Archetypes
    * Rogue - Ninja
        * The (unchained) ninja as a Rogue class archetype (inspired by Holic75's [Call of the Wild](https://github.com/Holic75/KingmakerRebalance/releases)'s version) and in a Unity Mod Manager-compatible format^.

* Spells
    * Obscuring Mist
        * A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
    * Sanctuary
        * Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can’t directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act.

Notes:
^ = I know that there is a Ninja class mod from Sigurd on the Nexus, but the last update is of months ago, I failed to persuade the author to make a UMM-compatible version and, on
top of all, I really prefer to have the Ninja as an archetype of the Rogue instead of a separate class (in TT it's an "alternate class", which essentially is an archetype in which
Paizo hasn't disclosed which class features were replaced).

# Tome of Darkness
---

This module provides new archetypes, class features, feats, spell and items for Wrath of the Righteous.

And also some more random stuff that I wanted to see in the game.

All homebrew content or divergences from TT will be called out, but most homebrew content will probably be overpowered.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version.
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous.
3. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases) mod from the releases page.
4. Download the [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base/releases) mod from the releases page.
5. Download the mod from the releases page.
6. Install the mods by dragging the zip file from step 3 & 4 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab.

Notes:
^ = I know that there is a Ninja class mod from Sigurd on the Nexus, but the last update is of months ago, I failed to persuade the author to make a UMM-compatible version and, on
top of all, I really prefer to have the Ninja as an archetype of the Rogue instead of a separate class (in TT it's an "alternate class", which essentially is an archetype in which
Paizo hasn't disclosed which class features were replaced).

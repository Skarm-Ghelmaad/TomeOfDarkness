The metaphor of being "[dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)" dates back to 12th century, but
recognizes an universal truth about Humankind and its relationship with knowledge:

Everything we do is built upon the efforts, the sacrifices and the investigation that other people did in the past.

For the modification ("mod") of a game may sound a bit exaggerated, but I am merely an ex-Finance professional with a smattering of Visual Basic for Application
who used to develop macros for work spreadsheets, so I have to admit that I have very little understanding of software development upon which to build, even to develop
a simple mod written in C# for a Unity game...so, as another member of the Pathfinder WotR community (Balkoth) correctly pointed out I "take bit and pieces" from other people's code
"put them together and pray it works"!

In many cases I go back to the Discord channel complaining that the "game" spit out my code with some mysterious error message of which I can barely understand a few bits and
more savvy community members point me out that probably I should proceed at little steps (which is a wise suggestion)!

This just to point out how extremely basic and "patched up" is my understanding of how C#, Unity and this lovely Unity game I'm trying to mod work is!

A lot of the things done in this mod are merely attempts to "port" bits and pieces of codes done for the previous Pathfinder Kingmaker by much more savvy and
talented modders and most of time this is done by leveraging the code that Vek17 (author of [TabletopTweaks Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and other amazing mods )
wrote for his TabletopTweaks Core...so a lot of "my" code is a derivative code "borrowed" from other people!

( ...and, obviously, a lot of code is just a pale attempt to imitate and put together bits of the official code from Owlcat, whose complexity is simply unreachable for me!!)

Since I want to recognize when an element is essentially a "port" I will use the following coding to recognize when a bit of code was ported (or, when feasible, straight-away copy-and-pasted).

## Credits Coding

#<Author>_SC# = "Straight Copy". This code was merely copy-and-pasted from the original as it needed no change. In some cases I just altered the naming conventions of classes and methods to match my tastes.

#<Author>_PT# = "Port". This code was ported and required some adjustments to ensure that the code would work for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous. Please note that, in many cases, these adjustments involve changing the variable names to match the 
			    new Owlcat code or changing the object type from a Blueprint to a Blueprint reference. Please note that, whenever possible, I've tried to leverage the work done by [Vek17](https://github.com/Vek17) for his TabletopTweaks Core mod, because
			    some of his solutions required a complete rethinking of how the code was written but often solve the same problems...

#Holic75_SC# = This code was merely copy-and-pasted from [Holic75](https://github.com/Holic75)'s code, generally from his main [Call of the Wild](https://github.com/Holic75/KingmakerRebalance) mod for Pathfinder Kingmaker.

#Holic75_PT# = This code was ported from [Holic75](https://github.com/Holic75)'s code, generally from his main [Call of the Wild](https://github.com/Holic75/KingmakerRebalance) mod for Pathfinder Kingmaker.
